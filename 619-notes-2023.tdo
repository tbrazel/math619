\contentsline {todo}{All these tables are wrong, I had made a mistake. There should be only $n$ not $n+1$ points in a configuration of $n$ points inside $I$. They should be labels on the points, not the intervals. Need to fix and draw new pictures.}{78}{section*.4}%
\contentsline {todo}{We should be consistent in $d_i$, $s_j$, etc. I think this is a common thing in the literature to use different indexing notation.}{81}{section*.5}%
